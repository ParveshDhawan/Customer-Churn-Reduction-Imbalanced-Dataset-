# Customer Churn Reduction Imbalanced Dataset

### Introduction

Customer churn refers to when a customer (player, subscriber, user, etc.) ceases his or her relationship with a company. Businesses typically treat a customer as churned once a particular amount of time has elapsed since the customer’s last interaction with the site or service. The full cost of customer churn includes both lost revenue and the marketing costs involved with replacing those customers with new ones. Reduction customer churn is important because cost of acquiring a new customer is higher than retaining an existing one. Reducing customer churn is a key business goal of every business. This case is related to telecom industry where particular organizations want to know that for given certain parameters whether a person will churn or not.



### Problem Statement

In this problem statement, we were provided with a train and test dataset of a telecom company. The data set consists of 20 variables describing various services and charges associated with them, duration and any service calls made by customer. The dataset also contains geographic location of customers in form of state and a particular area code. ‘Churn’ is the target variable, which tells us weather the customer has churned out or not.

### Data

Two different (files as Test.csv and Train.csv) datasets were provided as train data and test data. Data contains 20 predictor variables and 1 target variables. 


| Variables | Description |
| --- | --- |
| State *	 | State to which customer belongs |
| Account length | Service usage period |
| Area code | Telephone area code |
| Phone number * | Customer’s phone number |
| International plan * | ‘yes’ if customer opted for international plan else ‘no’ |
| Voice mail plan * | ‘yes’ if customer opted for voice mail plan else ‘no’ |
| Number vmail messages | Number of voice messages stored or received by customer |
